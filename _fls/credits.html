      First, my biggest thanks to my best friend, who had to listen to me ramble
      on about this website, who made the logo, who helped my through it all -
      you know who you are. One huge thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second of all, <a href="https://www.nookazon.com">Nookazon.com</a> Has
      given me a <strong>huge</strong> amount of inspiration. Thanks to everyone
      that works on that project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, Nintendo made Animal Crossing. They deserve a huge thank you. The
      game is so complex, and I just have to give some sort of credit in some
      way to them.
    </p>
    <h3>Now, It's time for all the resources that I used for this.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.vultr.com">Vultr</a> - So underrated. These guys
        are awesome.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> - Thanks for keeping
        so much of the web (including acnhtools. com) safe and working.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
